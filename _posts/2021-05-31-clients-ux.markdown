Even though agencies and thought leaders I respect, such as 37signals (now Basecamp) and Thoughtbot have always advocated for creating wireframes with paper and pencil, I have instead found success by doing this straight in Figma. It’s amazing how Figma can help you go from idea to finished product in very little time. I still wonder how we got that done in other tools like photoshop without pulling our hairs out back in the day.

I have tried creating mockups and wireframes in low fidelity mockup tools like Whimsical, Balsamiq mockups, etc and what I’ve found is that the basic UI elements these tools expect one to build upon eventually influence the design of the product I am building. I can quite understand why they provide that but in most cases, it serves more as a hindrance to me than of help. But in Figma, I can quickly drum up low-fi sketches and clickable prototypes (responsive to boot!) and gradually add more color and flair over time and before I know it, the product is complete.

One benefit I don’t think I quite appreciate enough is the fact that this approach allows me to carry the client along on every step of the process and we can identify how the design might fail at the start before spending resources building using the wrong approach.

I can not quite remember the first time I came across the ‘Under promise but over deliver’ advice, but I have so internalized this that it surprises me when my clients reward me for it. And I can’t help but nod at myself approvingly for working this way. At the end of the day, I am contracted to ease a part of the burden of running a business. My clients want to be able to outsource the problem they are facing to someone else to take care of. As long as I remain a trustworthy partner that consistently pulls this off, I can do what is right by them and we all remain better off for it.

I will always appreciate clients with domain knowledge in their startups. How I usually come in is by providing my clients with the tech support they need to take this in-depth knowledge they already possess about their businesses and convert that into the scalable tech they can offer to their customers. So a client that knows the worth of what we are building will always understand that this is an investment and not only a cost. These clients compensate accordingly and I can continue to build the best product possible. So always a win-win situation no matter how you look at it.
