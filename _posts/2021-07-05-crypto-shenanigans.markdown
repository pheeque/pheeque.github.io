It's been longer than usual since I last created a post on here. Nothing very exciting to report besides the regular coding and design work I have been involved with for new and existing clients.

To improve on my design capabilities, I have placed an order for a drawing tablet. This should arrive in the coming month so I'm excited for that. I do good enough work with my mouse already so curious to see the level of improvement of my abilities with the addition of a drawing tablet to my arsenal.

Developing for crypto has been quite the adventure. I really do want to see how crypto can uplift people and improve upon everyone's lives but the current generation of cryptocurrency and the sorrounding ecosystem is mostly filled with dubious people with nefarious agendas. I have had to turn down and abandon two projects recently because their mission was not quite clear. I am not saying that I would be ignoring the industry in general, but I would definitely be more careful selecting the kind of crypto projects I am involved in going forward.
