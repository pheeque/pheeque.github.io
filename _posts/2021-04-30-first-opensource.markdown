I had my first open source contribution merged today! It’s a little source code change, but it sits at the core of what the package does.

Products built in the past are not always enough to showcase what a contractor brings to the table. Some of my more technical clients, both prospective and current, have at some point asked to see some of the open source contributions I have made. Which makes sense as it serves as a low cost way to gauge a contractor’s skill without having to spend time (or sometimes money in case of paid tests) on code tests. 

I have also for a long time benefited from the use of open source packages in my daily work. It only makes sense that I helped out in whatever way I can.

My plan is to open at least one pull request to an open source repository every week. So I’m glad I was able to get my PR opened this week and have it merged today.

Onto the next!
